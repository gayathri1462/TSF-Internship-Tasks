# TSF-Internship-Tasks
The Sparks Foundation i.e.,  GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program ) tasks assigned for Data Science &amp; Business Analytics. 


Task 1 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning. In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
